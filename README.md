Visualization with prosections
----------
Visualization with prosections is a visualization method that uses prosection (projection of a section) to visualize 4D approximation sets in 3D. The method adequately reproduces the shape, range and distribution of vectors in the observed approximation sets and can handle multiple large approximation sets while being robust and computationally inexpensive. Even more importantly, for numerous vectors, the visualization with prosections preserves the Pareto dominance relation and relative closeness to reference vectors.
